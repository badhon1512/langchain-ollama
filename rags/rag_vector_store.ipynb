Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols.\\n\\nBangladesh,[a] officially the People\\'s Republic of Bangladesh,[b] is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world and among the most densely populated with a population exceeding 170 million within an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320\\xa0sq\\xa0mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. To the north, it is separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation\\'s political, financial, and cultural centre. Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest port of the country. The official language is Bengali. Islam is the official and largest religion and Bengali Muslims form the largest ethnoreligious group in the country.\\nBangladesh is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of British India in 1947 as the eastern exclave of the Dominion of Pakistan. Ancient Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a stronghold of pre-Islamic kingdoms. The Muslim conquest after 1204 led to the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of British rule for next 200 years. The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. The All-India Muslim League, which was founded in Dhaka in 1906,[13] fought for a separate Bengali Muslim homeland in the Eastern Bengal, which was proposed in the Lahore Resolution in 1940 by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal. The present-day territorial boundary was established with the announcement of the Radcliffe Line.\\nIn 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan and was renamed East Pakistan, with Dhaka as the legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the 1958 Pakistani coup d\\'état, and the 1970 Pakistani general election spurred Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer power to the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, triggered the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The Mukti Bahini waged a successful armed revolution; the conflict saw the Bangladeshi genocide. The country came into existence on 16 December 1971 after the surrender of Pakistan, ending the 9-month long Liberation War.\\nAfter the war, Sheikh Mujib became the leader of the country. Mujib\\'s assassination in 1975 led to the rise of Ziaur Rahman, who himself was assassinated in 1981. The 1980s was dominated by the presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was overthrown in a mass uprising in 1990. After 1990, the \"Battle of the Begums\" between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina defined Bangladesh\\'s politics and history for next three decades. Following the overthrow of Hasina in a student–led mass uprising in August 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus took power.\\nBangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. It is a middle power with the second-largest economy in South Asia. Bangladesh is home to the third-largest Muslim-majority population and the fifth-most spoken native language. It maintains the third-largest military in South Asia and is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. It consists of eight divisions, 64 districts, and 495 sub districts, and includes the largest mangrove forest in the world. However, Bangladesh has one of the largest refugee populations in the world and continues to face challenges such as corruption, political instability, overpopulation, and the effects of climate change. It has twice chaired the Climate Vulnerable Forum and hosts the headquarters of the BIMSTEC. Bangladesh is also a founding member of SAARC and a member of the OIC and the Commonwealth of Nations.\\n\\n\\nEtymology\\nMain article: Names of Bengal\\nThe etymology of Bangladesh (\"Bengali country\") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore and Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam, used the term in 1905 and 1932 respectively.[14] Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in East Pakistan. \\nThe term Bangla is a major name for both the Bengal region and the Bengali language. The origins of the term Bangla are unclear, with theories pointing to a Bronze Age proto-Dravidian tribe,[15] and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom.[16] The earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in 805\\xa0AD. The term Vangala Desa is found in 11th-century South Indian records.[17][18] The term gained official status during the Sultanate of Bengal in the 14th century.[19][20] Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the first \"Shah of Bangala\" in 1342.[19] The word Bangāl became the most common name for the region during the Islamic period.[21] 16th-century historian Abu\\'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak mentions in his Ain-i-Akbari that the addition of the suffix \"al\" came from the fact that the ancient rajahs of the land raised mounds of earth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called \"al\".[22] This is also mentioned in Ghulam Husain Salim\\'s Riyaz-us-Salatin.[23]\\nThe Indo-Aryan suffix Desh is derived from the Sanskrit word deśha, which means \"land\" or \"country\". Hence, the name Bangladesh means \"Land of Bengal\" or \"Country of Bengal\".[18]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Bangladesh\\nThe history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia to the Chalcolithic period. The region\\'s early history was characterized by a succession of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires that fought for control over the Bengal region. Islam arrived in the 8th century and gradually became dominant from the early 13th century with the conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1204 and the activities of Sunni missionaries like Shah Jalal. Muslim rulers promoted the spread of Islam by building mosques across the region. In 1338 Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah established independent sultanate in Bengal, establishing the capital at Sonargaon and founded an individual currency. The Bengal Sultanate expanded under rulers like Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, leading to economic prosperity and military dominance, with Bengal being referred to by Europeans as the richest country to trade with. The region later became a part of the Mughal Empire. By the 18th century, Mughal Bengal emerged as the wealthiest province of the empire. [24]\\nFollowing the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, founded by Murshid Quli Khan in 1717. In 1757 the state led by Siraj-ud-Daulah was defeated by the British East India Company in the Battle of Plassey. The British abolished local rule in Bengal in 1793 following their victories at the Battle of Plassey (1757) and the Battle of Buxar (1764), effectively taking complete control of the region; this event is considered the end of the Nawab\\'s power in Bengal and the start of direct British rule in Bengal. Bengal played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution in Britain at the expense of flight of Bengal\\'s capital, and also faced significant deindustrialization. The Great Bengal famine of 1770 resulted in millions of deaths. The Bengal Presidency was established during British rule.[25]\\nThe borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal between India and Pakistan during the Partition of India in August 1947, when the region became East Pakistan as part of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan following the end of the British rule in the region.[26] The Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence on 26 March 1971 by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led to the nine-month-long Bangladesh Liberation War, which culminated in the emergence of the independent People\\'s Republic of Bangladesh after victory was achieved on 16 December 1971.[26] Dhaka became the capital of independent Bangladesh.\\n\\nSiraj-ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal\\nThe Constitution of Bangladesh, enacted in 1972, established a democratic state with fundamental rights, an independent judiciary, and an elected parliament called the Jatiya Sangsad.[27] Since gaining independence, Bangladesh has faced issues of political instability, economic reconstruction, and social transformation. The country experienced one party socialism under Sheikh Mujib in 1975, followed by military coups and military rule, notably under General Ziaur Rahman and General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. During the 1970s and the 1980s gradual economic liberalization and free market reforms were promoted, while Islam was declared the state religion in 1988. The country however experienced severe population boom despite its small land.[28][29][30] After the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1991, the country saw power alternate between Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, an era dubbed the \"Battle of the Begums\"; which defined Bangladesh\\'s politics and history for next 34 years.[31][32][33] For most of the 21st Century, Bangladesh has achieved significant economic growth, emerging as one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies, driven by its garment industry, remittances, and infrastructure development. However, it continues to grapple with political instability, human rights issues, and the impact of climate change. The return of the Awami League to power on 6 January 2009 under Sheikh Hasina\\'s leadership saw economic progress but criticisms of authoritarianism. Bangladesh has played a critical role in addressing regional issues, including the Rohingya refugee crisis, which has strained its resources and highlighted its humanitarian commitments.\\nBangladesh has achieved remarkable feats in reducing its poverty rate, which has gone down from 80% in 1971,[34] to 44.2% in 1991,[35] all the way down to 18.7% in 2022.[36] It has emerged as the second-largest economy in South Asia,[37][38] surpassing the per capita income levels of both India and Pakistan.[39][38] As part of the green transition, Bangladesh\\'s industrial sector emerged as a leader in building green factories, with the country having the largest number of certified green factories in the world in 2023.[40] In January 2024, Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina secured a fourth straight term in Bangladesh\\'s controversial general election. Following a mass uprising against the Awami League government, on 5 August 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee to India.[41] An interim government was formed on 8 August 2024, with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the Chief Advisor.[42]\\n\\nGeography\\nMain article: Geography of Bangladesh\\nPhysical map of Bangladesh\\nBangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[43] The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.\\nThe Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra (Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is called the \"Land of Rivers\",[44] as it is home to over 57 trans-boundary rivers, the most of any nation-state. Water issues are politically complicated since Bangladesh is downstream of India.[45]\\nBangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than 12\\xa0m (39\\xa0ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1\\xa0m (3.3\\xa0ft).[46] 12% of the country is covered by hill systems. The country\\'s haor wetlands are of significance to global environmental science. The highest point in Bangladesh is the Saka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064\\xa0m (3,491\\xa0ft).[47] Previously, either Keokradong or Tazing Dong were considered the highest.\\nIn Bangladesh forest cover is around 14% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,883,400 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 1,920,330 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 1,725,330 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 158,070 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 33% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.[48][49]\\n\\nClimate\\nMain articles: Geography of Bangladesh §\\xa0Climate, and Climate change in Bangladesh\\nA photo from space showing off the pollution over Bangladesh\\nStraddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh\\'s climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0\\xa0°C (32\\xa0°F), with a record low of 1.1\\xa0°C (34.0\\xa0°F) in the northwest city of Dinajpur on 3 February 1905.[50] A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country\\'s rainfall. Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost every year,[51] combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion. The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the latter killing approximately 140,000 people.[52]\\n\\nIn September 1998, Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern history, after which two-thirds of the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[53] As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[54] The 2007 South Asian floods ravaged areas across the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[55]Flooding after the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, which killed around 140,000\\xa0people\\nClimate change\\nMain article: Climate change in Bangladesh\\nBangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.[56][57] Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[58] Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[59] It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million people.[60] To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.[61][62]\\n\\nBiodiversity\\nMain article: Fauna of Bangladesh\\nA Bengal tiger, the national animal, in the Sundarbans\\nBangladesh is located in the Indomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions: Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests, Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests, Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, and Sundarbans mangroves.[63] Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous rivers and tributaries, lakes, wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist deciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut, and date palm.[64] The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants.[65] Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.\\nBangladesh is home to most of the Sundarbans, the world\\'s largest mangrove forest, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries: the South, East, and West zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includes tropical and subtropical coniferous forests, a freshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur, Tangail, and Mymensingh. St. Martin\\'s Island is the only coral reef in the country.\\nBangladesh has an abundance of wildlife in its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[64] The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi).[66] The Bengal tiger, clouded leopard, saltwater crocodile, black panther and fishing cat are among the chief predators in the Sundarbans.[67] Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to the Asian elephant, hoolock gibbon, Asian black bear and oriental pied hornbill.[68] The chital deer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include the black giant squirrel, capped langur, Bengal fox, sambar deer, jungle cat, king cobra, wild boar, mongooses, pangolins, pythons and water monitors. Bangladesh has one of the largest populations of Irrawaddy and Ganges dolphins.[69] The country has numerous species of amphibians (53), reptiles (139), marine reptiles (19) and marine mammals (5). It also has 628 species of birds.[70]\\nSeveral animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one-horned and two-horned rhinoceros and common peafowl. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. The country has widespread environmental issues; pollution of the Dhaleshwari River by the textile industry and shrimp cultivation in Chakaria Sundarbans have both been described by academics as ecocides.[71][72] Although many areas are protected under law, some Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as Ecologically Critical Areas, including wetlands, forests, and rivers. The Sundarbans tiger project and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.[68] It ratified the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 3 May 1994.[73] As of 2014[update], the country was set to revise its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.[73]\\n\\nGovernment and politics\\nMain articles: Government of Bangladesh and Politics of Bangladesh\\nThe National Parliament building in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, a neighborhood named after the first Prime Minister of Bengal.Bangabhaban (Translation: Bengal House) is the presidential palace of Bangladesh. It was originally a house for the Viceroy of India and the Governor of Bengal.\\nBangladesh, by constitution, is a unitary state[74] and a de jure representative democracy with a Westminster-style parliamentary system[75] that has universal suffrage.[76] The government can be divided into three pillars: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary—all function harmoniously to ensure accountability, transparency and checks and balances of the government.[74] Since its independence, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have remained two of the most powerful political parties in Bangladesh.[75]\\n\\nThe first pillar of the government is the executive organ, which is entrusted with the total administration of the country.[74] Executive powers are largely vested in the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, and oversees the cabinet.[74] The tenure of a parliamentary government is five years. Various ministers form the bulk of the executive organ, overseeing government departments and forming policies.[74] The Civil Service assists the ministers in implementing the policies.[74] All authorities unite to formulate policies, manage public services, and implement national development plans.[74] The President is the ceremonial head of state, whose powers include signing bills passed by parliament into law and maintaining the government\\'s stability and continuity;[74] as well as fulfilling their duties as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces[77] and the chancellor of all universities.[78]\\nThe second pillar of the government is the legislative organ, also known as the Jatiya Sangsad (House of the Nation).[79] Citizens across the country vote to elect the members of parliament (MPs).[74] The unicameral parliament has 350 MPs, including 300 elected on the first past the post system and 50 appointed to reserved seats for women\\'s empowerment.[79][80] Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh forbids MPs from voting against their party.[81] The parliament is presided over by the Speaker, who is second in line to the president as per the constitution.[82]\\nThe third pillar of the government is the judiciary branch, which is in charge of interpreting the law, resolving conflicts, and maintaining justice across the nation.[74] The Supreme Court is the highest court, separated into the Appellate Division and the High Court Division.[83][74] It is led by the Chief Justice with the assistance of other justices.[83] The judiciary has the power to assess a law\\'s constitutionality and offer legal remedies. Protecting citizens\\' rights, making sure the law is applied fairly, and preserving the balance of power within the government are all made possible by the court.[74] The courts have wide latitude in judicial review, and judicial precedent is supported by Article 111 of the constitution.[84] The judiciary includes district and metropolitan courts divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog.[85]\\nAdministrative divisions\\nMain article: Administrative geography of Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Divisions of Bangladesh, Districts of Bangladesh, and Upazilas of Bangladesh\\nA clickable map of Bangladesh exhibiting its divisions.\\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,[86][47][87] each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal[88]), Chittagong (officially Chattogram[88]), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.\\nDivisions are subdivided into districts (zila). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into upazila (subdistricts) or thana. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, further divided into mahallas.\\nThere are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and several members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.[89]\\n\\n\\nAdministrative Divisions of Bangladesh\\n\\n\\nDivision\\n\\nCapital\\n\\nEstablished\\n\\nArea (km2)[90]\\n\\n2021 Population (projected)[91]\\n\\nDensity2021\\n\\n\\nBarisal Division\\n\\nBarisal\\n\\n1 January 1993\\n\\n13,225\\n\\n9,713,000\\n\\n734\\n\\n\\nChittagong Division\\n\\nChittagong\\n\\n1 January 1829\\n\\n33,909\\n\\n34,747,000\\n\\n1,025\\n\\n\\nDhaka Division\\n\\nDhaka\\n\\n1 January 1829\\n\\n20,594\\n\\n42,607,000\\n\\n2,069\\n\\n\\nKhulna Division\\n\\nKhulna\\n\\n1 October 1960\\n\\n22,284\\n\\n18,217,000\\n\\n817\\n\\n\\nMymensingh Division\\n\\nMymensingh\\n\\n14 September 2015\\n\\n10,584\\n\\n13,457,000\\n\\n1,271\\n\\n\\nRajshahi Division\\n\\nRajshahi\\n\\n1 January 1829\\n\\n18,153\\n\\n21,607,000\\n\\n1,190\\n\\n\\nRangpur Division\\n\\nRangpur\\n\\n25 January 2010\\n\\n16,185\\n\\n18,868,000\\n\\n1,166\\n\\n\\nSylhet Division\\n\\nSylhet\\n\\n1 August 1995\\n\\n12,635\\n\\n12,463,000\\n\\n986\\n\\nForeign relations\\nMain article: Foreign relations of Bangladesh\\nCountries that share diplomatic relations with BangladeshU.S. President Joe Biden with Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City\\nBangladesh is considered a middle power in global politics.[92] It plays an important role in the geopolitical affairs of the Indo-Pacific,[93] due to its strategic location between South and Southeast Asia.[94] Bangladesh joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 and the United Nations in 1974.[95][96] It relies on multilateral diplomacy on issues like climate change, nuclear non-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nproliferation, trade policy and non-traditional security issues.[97] Bangladesh pioneered the creation of SAARC, which has been the preeminent forum for regional diplomacy among the countries of the Indian subcontinent.[98] It joined the OIC in 1974,[99] and is a founding member of the Developing-8.[100] In recent years, Bangladesh has focused on promoting regional trade and transport links with support from the World Bank.[101] Dhaka hosts the headquarters of BIMSTEC, an organisation that brings together countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal.\\nRelations with neighbouring Myanmar have been severely strained since 2016–2017, after over 700,000 Rohingya refugees illegally entered Bangladesh.[102] The parliament, government, and civil society of Bangladesh have been at the forefront of international criticism against Myanmar for military operations against the Rohingya, and have demanded their right of return to Arakan.[103][104]\\nBangladesh shares an important bilateral and economic relationship with its largest neighbour India,[105] which is often strained by water politics of the Ganges and the Teesta,[106][107][108] and the border killings of Bangladeshi civilians.[109][110] Post-independent Bangladesh has continued to have a problematic relationship with Pakistan, mainly due to its denial of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide.[111] It maintains a warm relationship with China, which is its largest trading partner, and the largest arms supplier.[112] Japan is Bangladesh\\'s largest economic aid provider, and the two maintain a strategic and economic partnership.[113] Political relations with Middle Eastern countries are robust.[114] Bangladesh receives 59% of its remittances from the Middle East,[115] despite poor working conditions affecting over four million Bangladeshi workers.[116] Bangladesh plays a major role in global climate diplomacy as a leader of the Climate Vulnerable Forum.[117]\\n\\nMilitary\\nMain article: Bangladesh Armed Forces\\nBangladesh Army personnel on a BTR-80.Bangladesh Navy Frigate, BNS Bangabandhu.Mig-29 and F-7, Fighter aircraft’s of Bangladesh Air Force.\\nThe Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the British military and the British Indian Army.[118] In 2022, the active personnel strength of the Bangladesh Army was around 250,000,[119] excluding the Air Force and the Navy (24,000).[120] In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world\\'s largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces.[121] The military budget of Bangladesh accounts for 1.3% of GDP, amounting to US$4.3 billion in 2021.[122][123]\\nThe Bangladesh Navy, one of the largest in the Bay of Bengal, includes a fleet of frigates, submarines, corvettes, and other vessels. The Bangladesh Air Force has a small fleet of multi-role combat aircraft. Most of Bangladesh\\'s military equipment comes from China.[124] In recent years, Bangladesh and India have increased joint military exercises, high-level visits of military leaders, counter-terrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing. Bangladesh is vital to ensuring stability and security in northeast India.[125][126]\\nBangladesh\\'s strategic importance in the eastern subcontinent hinges on its proximity to China, its frontier with Burma, the separation of mainland and northeast India, and its maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal.[127] In 2002, Bangladesh and China signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement.[128] The United States has pursued negotiations with Bangladesh on a Status of Forces Agreement, an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement and a General Security of Military Information Agreement.[129][130][131] In 2019, Bangladesh ratified the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[132]\\n\\nCivil society\\nMain article: List of non-governmental organisations in Bangladesh\\nSince the colonial period, Bangladesh has had a prominent civil society. There are various special interest groups, including non-governmental organisations, human rights organisations, professional associations, chambers of commerce, employers\\' associations, and trade unions.[133] The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh was set up in 2007. Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include the Centre for Law and Mediation, Odhikar, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee. The world\\'s largest international NGO BRAC is based in Bangladesh. There have been concerns regarding the shrinking space for independent civil society in recent years.[134][135][136]\\n\\nHuman rights\\nMain article: Human rights in Bangladesh\\nThe Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) have been widely accused of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and human right abuses. The United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned RAB in 2021.[137]\\nTorture is banned by the Constitution of Bangladesh,[138] but is rampantly used by Bangladesh\\'s security forces. Bangladesh joined the Convention against Torture in 1998 and it enacted its first anti-torture law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, in 2013. The first conviction under this law was announced in 2020.[139] Amnesty International Prisoners of Conscience from Bangladesh have included Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Shahidul Alam.[140][141] The widely criticized Digital Security Act was repealed and replaced by the Cyber Security Act in 2023.[142] The repeal was welcomed by the International Press Institute.[143]\\nOn International Human Rights Day in December 2021, the United States Department of the Treasury announced sanctions on commanders of the Rapid Action Battalion for extrajudicial killings, torture, and other human rights abuses.[144] Freedom House has criticised the government for human rights abuses, the crackdown on the opposition, mass media, and civil society through politicized enforcement.[145] Bangladesh is ranked \"partly free\" in Freedom House\\'s Freedom in the World report,[146] but its press freedom has deteriorated from \"free\" to \"not free\" in recent years due to increasing pressure from the government.[147] According to the British Economist Intelligence Unit, the country has a hybrid regime: the third of four rankings in its Democracy Index.[148] Bangladesh was ranked 96th among 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index.[149] According to National Human Rights Commission, 70% of alleged human-rights violations are committed by law-enforcement agencies.[150]\\nLGBT rights are frowned upon among social conservatives.[151] Homosexuality is affected by Section 377 of the Penal Code of Bangladesh, which was originally enacted by the British colonial government.[152][153] The government only recognises the transgender and intersex community known as the Hijra.[154][155] According to the 2023 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 1.2 million people were enslaved in Bangladesh as of 2021[update], which is among the highest in the world.[156]\\n\\nCorruption\\nMain article: Corruption in Bangladesh\\nLike many developing countries, institutional corruption is an issue of concern for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was ranked 146th among 180 countries on Transparency International\\'s 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index.[157] Land administration was the sector with the most bribery in 2015,[158] followed by education,[159] police[160] and water supply.[161] The Anti Corruption Commission was formed in 2004, and it was active during the 2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis, indicting many leading politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen for graft.[162][163][164]\\n\\nEconomy\\nMain article: Economy of Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Tourism in Bangladesh and List of companies of Bangladesh\\nMotijheel in the nation\\'s capital Dhaka is the largest commercial district in the cityThe Padma Bridge, opened in 2022, is a road-rail bridge which spans the Padma RiverThe Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world\\nBangladesh\\'s lower-middle income mixed-market economy is among the fastest growing economies in the world.[165][166] A rapidly developing country, it has the world\\'s 36th-largest economy by nominal terms, and the 24th-largest by PPP. Bangladesh has a labor force of 71.4 million,[167] which is the world\\'s seventh-largest; with an unemployment rate of 5.1% as of 2023[update].[168] Its foreign exchange reserves, although depleting,[169] remain the second-highest in South Asia, after India. Bangladesh\\'s large diaspora contributed roughly $27\\xa0billion in remittances in 2024.[170] The Bangladeshi taka is the national currency.\\nAs of 2023[update], the large service sector accounts for about 51.5% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (34.6%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up only 11% of total GDP;[6] despite being the largest employment sector, providing roughly half of the total workforce.[171] Over 84% of the export earnings come from the textile industry.[172] Bangladesh is the second-leading garments exporter in the world, and plays a crucial role in the global fast fashion industry, exporting to various Western fashion brands.[173] It is also a major producer of jute,[174] rice,[175] fish,[176] tea,[177] and flowers.[178] Other major industries include shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, steel, electronics and leather goods.[179] China is the largest trading partner of Bangladesh, accounting for 15% of the total trade, followed by India; which accounts for 8% of the total trade.[180]\\nThe private sector accounts for 80% of GDP compared to the dwindling role of state-owned companies.[181] Bangladesh\\'s economy is dominated by family-owned conglomerates and small and medium-sized businesses. Some of the largest publicly traded companies in Bangladesh include BEXIMCO, BRAC Bank, BSRM, GPH Ispat, Grameenphone, Summit Group, and Square Pharmaceuticals.[182] The Dhaka and Chittagong Stock Exchanges are the country\\'s twin capital markets.[183] Its telecommunications industry is one of the world\\'s fastest growing, with 188.78 million cellphone subscribers at the end of November 2024.[184] Political instability,[185] high inflation,[186] endemic corruption,[187] insufficient power supplies,[188] and slow implementation of reforms are major challenges to economic growth.[186]\\nThe tourism industry is expanding, contributing some 3.02% of total GDP.[189] Bangladesh\\'s international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $391 million.[190] The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the Mosque City, the Buddhist Vihara and the Sundarbans) and seven tentative-list sites.[191] The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2019 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,180,500 jobs in 2018 or 1.9% of the country\\'s total employment.[192] According to the same report, Bangladesh experiences around 125,000 international tourist arrivals per year.[192] Domestic spending generated 97.7 percent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.[193]\\n\\nEnergy\\nMain article: Electricity sector in Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Energy policy of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Power Development Board, Natural gas and petroleum in Bangladesh, and Petrobangla\\nThe under-construction Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant at nightWind turbines on Kutubdia Island\\nBangladesh, a country experiencing daily blackouts several times a day in 2009, achieved 100% electrification by 2022.[194][195] It is gradually transitioning to a green economy and has the largest off-grid solar power programme in the world, benefiting 20 million people.[196] An electric car called the Palki is being developed for production in the country.[197] Biogas is being used to produce organic fertilizer.[198] The under-construction Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, under-construction with assistance from the Russian company Rosatom, will be the first operational nuclear power plant in the country. Its first unit, out of the two total units, is expected to go into operation in 2025.[199]\\nBangladesh continues to have huge untapped reserves of natural gas, particularly in its maritime territory.[200][201] A lack of exploration and decreasing proven reserves have forced Bangladesh to import LNG from abroad.[202][203][204] Gas shortages were further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[205] Bangladesh stopped buying spot price LNG temporarily in July 2022, despite constant load-shedding, due to a steep price hike in the global market.[206] It restarted buying spot price LNG once again in February 2023 as prices eased.[207]\\nWhile government-owned companies in Bangladesh generate nearly half of Bangladesh\\'s electricity, privately owned companies like the Summit Group and Orion Group are playing an increasingly important role in both generating electricity, and supplying machinery, reactors, and equipment.[208] Bangladesh increased electricity production from 5 gigawatts in 2009 to 25.5 gigawatts in 2022. It plans to produce 50 gigawatts by 2041. U.S. companies like Chevron and General Electric supply around 55% of Bangladesh\\'s domestic natural gas production and are among the largest investors in power projects. 80% of Bangladesh\\'s installed gas-fired power generation capacity comes from turbines manufactured in the United States.[209]\\n\\nDemographics\\nMain article: Demographics of Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Bengalis\\nPopulation (millions)YearPop.±% p.a.1960 51,828,660—\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01971 70,276,758+2.81%1980 88,016,432+2.53%1990 111,633,717+2.41%2000 134,544,304+1.88%2010 152,201,981+1.24%2023 171,466,990+0.92%Source: World Bank[210]\\nAccording to the 2022 Census, Bangladesh has a population of 165.1 million,[7] and is the eighth-most-populous country in the world, the fifth-most populous country in Asia, and the most densely populated large country in the world, with a headline population density of 1,265 people/km2 as of 2020[update].[211] Its total fertility rate (TFR), once among the highest in the world, has experienced a dramatic decline, from 5.5 in 1985 to 3.7 in 1995, down to 1.9 in 2022,[212] which is below the sub-replacement fertility of 2.1.[213] The majority of Bangladeshis live in rural areas, with 40% of the population living in urban areas as of 2023[update].[214] It has a median age of roughly 28 years, with 26% of the total population aged 14 or younger,[215] and merely 6% aged 65 and above as of 2023[update].[216]\\nBangladesh is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society, as Bengalis form 99% of the population.[6] The Adivasi population includes the Chakmas, Marmas, Santhals, Mros, Tanchangyas, Bawms, Tripuris, Khasis, Khumis, Kukis, Garos, and Bisnupriya Manipuris. The Chittagong Hill Tracts region experienced unrest and an insurgency from 1975 to 1997 in an autonomy movement by its indigenous people. Although a peace accord was signed in 1997, the region remains militarised.[217] Urdu-speaking stranded Pakistanis were given citizenship by the Supreme Court in 2008.[218] Bangladesh also hosts over 700,000 Rohingya refugees since 2017, giving it one of the largest refugee populations in the world.[102]\\n\\nUrban centres\\nFurther information: List of cities and towns in Bangladesh\\nBangladesh\\'s capital Dhaka and the largest city and is overseen by two city corporations that manage between them the northern and southern parts of the city.

It is highly possible that people who came across a news\\ndon’t justify it before believing. Majority of people believe a news on\\nthe basis of its spreading. But believing a news which is fake impacts\\nthe world including politics, economics, education, health, business,\\ncommunications and many more domains of life. To bounce back\\nfrom these impacts, it is necessary to know in depth of fake news\\nand its properties. Thus, in this paper we discuss the real definitions\\nof fake news, how a fake news is made, and its impact on life\\nand the science behind fake news. As currently people are more\\ninterested to research on fake news, we discuss and analyze existing\\ndetecting methodologies, dividing each into certain criteria. Finally,\\nwe conclude by giving a table which contains comparative analysis\\nof detecting methods and suggested some future work.\\nKEYWORDS\\nFake news, Fake News Detection Method, Social Media, Satire,\\nHoaxes\\nACM Reference Format:\\nMd.

But it creates problem when those citizens\\nstart to believe a news which is merely true. Anyone can easily\\nget access to news information sources because of the internet and\\nsocial media [3]. In this present era, a news which is not true, can\\neasily make a person’s mind to believe it as true in that much which\\nprovokes the person to share it with other people.\\nThis article describes a depth portion of the properties of fake\\nnews along with existing detection methods which are mostly in\\nthe region of social media and online news article. The goal of the\\nresearch paper is to help people both from non-research background\\nand research background to understand and work with fake news.\\nThe research paper gives an overview of fake news including its\\nhistory, impacts, sources of fake news and how fake news are made\\nwhich is enough for one to understand the wholesome of fake\\nnews. As recently, research on fake news is getting interested by\\nresearch community, we also worked to help them by discussing\\nand analyzing existing works and come up with a comparative table\\nso that is becomes easy to pick one for any research purpose.\\n2 THE SCIENCE OF FAKE NEWS\\nPeople nowadays mostly relies on social media as a news source\\nnowadays because of mainly two reasons – 1. Getting news from\\nsocial media is less expensive and it requires less time comparing to\\ntraditional news sources. 2. It is easy to share, comment and interact\\nwith news sources in social media [ 17]. The rate has increased\\nfrom 49 percent to 62 percent for the adult users in U.S. from 2012\\nto 2016 [ 18] [21]. In Facebook, like-minded people often create\\ngroups where they promote, consume and share fake contents\\namong themselves. They also assume this news to be true due to\\nthe lack of proper evidence. This is called the Echo Chamber Effect\\n[18]. They belief such things because of two psychological reasons-\\n1. Social credibility: People tends to perceive a source as credible\\nwhen they find other people perceiving the source as credible even\\nthough there is no evidence to support the truthfulness of these\\nsources.\\n2. Frequency heuristic: If a large number of people supports an\\nidea or holds a belief, then it influences others to support that idea.', metadata={'source': 'A-comperative-analysis-on-fake-news-detection-methods.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Badhon Miah, Tawhid Khondakar, Atanu Saha, Arrafi Ahsan Somudro, and Dr. Dip Nandi\\nAlso, due to the echo chamber effect, people are more likely to\\ncreate communities with specific ideologies and spreading them\\namong themselves.\\n3 IMPACTS\\nResearch has shown that people prefer to belief information that\\nsatisfies with their pre-existing thought process which means peo-\\nple are emotionally biased towards accepting information weather\\nit is a superstition or mutual belief in a conservative community\\n[6][1]. Social media platforms use complex statistical model to pre-\\ndict and show relevant information that matches the interest of\\nthe particular user [6]. But these models often ended up providing\\nthem the false information that they were seeking for. Human in-\\ntelligence is incapable to distinguish between real and fake news.\\nThere are two psychological factors that makes them vulnerable\\ntowards fake news [15] –\\n1. Naïve Realism: This is a term of social psychology that refers\\nthe human tendency to believe that their own perception of the\\nworld around them are the only accurate views and those who-\\never disagrees with them considered as biased, irrelevant and unin-\\nformed.\\n2. Confirmation bias: This is the tendency to accept and search\\nfor information that supports one’s prior beliefs and values. This\\nalso impact how people gather and recall information. For example,\\na person will seek information that supports or oppose a particular\\nissue. They will also interpret that information in a certain way\\nthat upholds the ideas which they support.\\nThese psychological biased factors increase misperceptions among\\nideological groups. Also, the desire for maximizing reward in social\\nnetwork by getting acceptance and response from the other users\\nis responsible for spreading fake news [15].\\n4 DEFINITION\\nSo, what really makes ’Fake News’ misleading? To know the answer,\\none should know about the definition of Fake News. There is not\\nyet an agreed definition for the term but there some key properties\\nof fake news which is widely adopted in many literatures and can\\nbe combined to use as a definition [15]. The word fake is related to\\nthe words copy, forgery, counterfeit, and inauthentic. Many authors\\nhave given the definition of fake news in their own way. Some of\\nthem are given below:\\n1. ’Fake news is an allegation that some story is misleading – it\\ncontains significant omissions – or even false – it is a lie – designed\\nto deceive its intended audience’ [2].\\n2. Another definition by [ 9] refers to fake news as ’ any false\\ninformation that is deliberately meant to be wholly or largely false\\nor misleading, spread through online social media, but occasionally\\nfinding its way to mainstream traditional print and broadcast news\\nmedia’.\\n3. [11] assumes ’ Fake news articles are intentionally fabricated\\nto be deceptive and can be proven that they are false’.\\n4. [14] defines fake news as the news which are deliberately and\\nverifiably false and could misguide the consumers while the broad\\ndefinitions focus on the authenticity and intent of the news content.\\n5. In another definition, ‘fake news can be represented as the\\nonline publication of intentionally or knowingly false statements\\nof fact’ [5].\\n6. The denouncing of media and journalism, using derogatory\\nterms can be regarded as part of a well-known strategy predating\\nthe popularization of the term fake news [12].\\nSatire news with proper context, there are also some rumors\\nthat does not belong to any news portal or conspiracy theory is\\ndifficult to verify whether it is real or fake. Unintentionally created\\nmisinformation, and hoaxes that are used for fun are not consid-\\nered as fake news [15]. In a nutshell, Fake news is the propaganda\\nof spreading wrong information which are done intentionally to\\nachieve financial profits and goals.\\n5 SOURCES\\nFake News can spread in various ways which indicates that it can\\ncontain many sources for-example oral message, print media, news\\nsites, social and news media. Fake news is false news intended to\\ndeceive people and does so by trying to look like real news [ 17].\\nNowadays online platforms create a huge opportunity for non-\\njournalists to make or spread fake news [18]. A study shows that\\n44% of the population in the USA gets their news from social media\\n[18]. Fake news is mainly manipulated and created by some propa-\\ngandists to convey political message or to achieve business profits\\nthrough advertising [15]. There are some malicious accounts on\\nsocial media that is fully autonomous and can interact with sys-\\ntems and users. Facebook, Google, Internet news sites and Twitter\\nare the major sources of fake news, while social media acts as a\\nminimal cost channel of distribution, where fake data if published\\nthen it spreads throughout the web as wildfire to mass through\\nretweets, likes and sharing [10]. Among these mentioned digital\\nmedia, majority people of any country consume news through so-\\ncial media because a news which has more likes, comments and\\nshares receives huge attention and people tends to like, comment\\nand share that again. A few famous websites of fake news include\\n“The Onion”, a sarcastic publication with a readership of 4.3 trillion,\\nFacebook, and Monticello [9]. There are some more web pages that\\npublish fake news purposely (For example, Denvergurdian.com,\\nwtoe5news.com, and ABCnews.com.co). These webpages publish\\nfake news like legit news organizations and intentionally produced\\nto distribute hoaxes, advertising, and false news to gain financial\\nand political benefits without the reader’s awareness [20].\\n6 GENERATORS AND BOTS\\nTo increase the spreading ratio of fake news, the creator often\\nuses Online Fake News Generation Tool. \"Break your own News\",\\n\"ClassTools Breaking News Generator\", \"The Fake News Genera-\\ntor\" are the most popular tool for fake news generation which only\\nneeds to upload picture, textual content, author and an eye-catching\\ntitle to create a Fake News. After this, the creator tends to spread\\nthe Fake News by posting it on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr etc. [10].\\nThere are some malicious accounts on social media that is fully au-\\ntonomous and can interact with systems and users. These accounts\\nare intentionally created and programmed to spread a particular\\nnews or advertisement to a group of people. These accounts are\\ncalled bot.

Fake news is widely spread by bots [16]. The scope and variety\\nof online fake news are understood by a few important aspects for\\ndefining fake news in Fig. 1, in the onion-shaped graph the term\\nfake new is the core of it, and it holds four main components: Cre-\\nator/ Spreader, Target Victims, News Content, and Social Context.\\nEvery component is in the first inner layer around “Fake News”\\n[20].\\nFigure 1: All the factors related with fake news\\n7 METHODS\\nFake news detection is a comparison between some authentic news-\\npapers with social news content [21]. Till now, authors have discov-\\nered some reliable methods which are able to detect a news as Fake\\nNews. It depends on style-based, propagation-based, credibility-\\nbased, and so on. Each identical maintains its own quality accessing\\ndatasets, different detection tricks in data mining, machine learning,\\nmany natural sources, and local search. All of these sources are\\nfinally generating a unified framework for the exploration of fake\\nnews. Some authentic detection methods are describing below:\\n7.1 Propagation Path Classification\\n7.1.1 Domain. [Weibo, Twitter] [7]\\n7.1.2 Theory. Author Yang Liu and Yi-Fang Brook Wu has de-\\nnoted their model as \"PPC\" (Propagation Path Classification), also\\nas \"PPC_RNN+CNN\" which also includes a reduced version of the\\nmain method. Propagation path is a model which is form with each\\nnews story as a two or more embedded series of time with adding\\ntuple on which each tuple is a numbered container shows habit-\\nual behavior of a user who has a connection directly or indirectly\\nwith spreading fake news. Along with this, recurrent and convo-\\nlutional networks related time series were added to capture user\\ncharacteristics and detect fake news [7].\\n7.1.3 Main Method. The fake news detection method proposed\\nby Yang Liu et al is a combination of four components includ-\\ning, 1) Propagation Path Construction and Transformation: From\\na news story a propagation path was constructed by identifying\\nusers whose are involve in propagating the news. Propagation path\\nAKA variable-length multivariate time series was constructed from\\nrelevant user profiles. For transforming the length of a variable\\nfrom multi organized series of time into a constant series of time\\nsequence an algorithm was used to get a vector representation\\nwhich basically encodes a global variation of user-characteristics.\\n2) RNN-Based Propagation Path Representation: Gated Recurrent\\nUnit (GRU) which is a variation of RNN was utilized for each of the\\ntransformed propagation path and then by applying mean pooling\\nit was possible to reduce the sequence of the output vectors which\\nis the final vector representation of the general deviation of the\\ncharacteristics of a user.\\n3) CNN-Based Propagation Path Representation: To adapt and\\nequip another delegation of vector, CNN was used for each of the\\ntransformed propagation path to generate final vector represen-\\ntation that encodes the local variation of user-characteristics by\\napplying mean pooling.\\n4) Propagation Path Classification After getting global varia-\\ntion of user characteristics from RNN and local variation of user-\\ncharacteristics from CNN, a single vector was concatenated which\\nrepresents the transformed propagation path. The final output\\nbrings probability distribution for the corresponding propagation\\npath.\\nA combination of three real world dataset Weibo, Twitter15,\\nTwitter16 were used to evaluate the proposed model where it was\\nestimated that for the validation of model it is necessary to hole\\n10% of the dataset, rest of the dataset were split with the ratio\\nof 3:1 for training and testing purpose. The proposed model was\\nimplemented using Keras (https://keras.io/) [7].\\n7.1.4 Accuracy. By evaluating the model through three real world\\ndataset, it was confirmed that the proposed model which is based\\non Propagation Path Classification can find out a news as a fake\\nnews with an extreme accuracy of 85% in Twitter and 92% in Weibo\\nin 5 minutes after it starts to spread.\\n7.2 Naïve Bayes\\n7.2.1 Domain. Facebook [3]\\n7.2.2 Theory. Mykhilo Granik and others provided a simple fake\\nnews detection approach. They used Naïve Bayes classifier to com-\\nplete the whole procedure execution successfully. Mainly, the ap-\\nproach they proposed was implemented as a software system. They\\ncollect a labeled dataset which contains Facebook posts and tested\\nagainst it which gave them a decent accuracy [3].\\n7.2.3 Main Method. Authors tried to figure out similarities be-\\ntween Spam message and the articles which contains fake news\\nand discovered that there are many significant landmark which\\nintersects between them. Inspired by these properties, authors tried\\nto use similar approach for fake news detection. Identify and get\\ninformation from each word of a news article was the key idea.\\nAs it is often recognized as True Positive that the news arti-\\ncles which uses same words more often are categorized as fake.\\nThough claiming a news fully fake is impossible but we can see that\\nthe number of similar type of words encounters maximum time\\nwhich changes the statistical probability. Formula for calculating\\nconditional probability of this fact using Bayes theorem is:\\n(1) Pr(F|W) = Pr(W|F) · Pr(F) / (Pr(W|F) · Pr(F) + Pr(W|T) · Pr(T))', metadata={'source': 'A-comperative-analysis-on-fake-news-detection-methods.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Badhon Miah, Tawhid Khondakar, Atanu Saha, Arrafi Ahsan Somudro, and Dr. Dip Nandi\\nPr(F|W) is known as the probability which represents every\\nsingle words belonging to a news article. After that it is neces-\\nsary to confirm that given news article is fake by using these\\nprobabilities using Spam filtering formulas, given below: (2) p1\\n= Pr(F|W1)·...·Pr(F|Wn), (3) p2 = (1 – Pr(F|W1))·...·(1 – Pr(F|Wn)), (4)\\np = p1 / (p1 + p2),\\nFor calculating the conditional probabilities of finding specific\\nword it was necessary to use a dataset of fake news contents labelled\\nas either True or False. For this BuzzFeed news dataset was used.\\nAfter filtering dataset, 1771 news articles was obtained and it was\\ndivided into 3 categories named as Training dataset which is used to\\ntrain the naïve bayes classifier, Validation dataset which is used to\\ntune the generic attributes of the classifier and Test dataset which\\nis used to get the detached measurement of well performing.

There\\nare two types of content available which are textual content and\\nnon-textual content. Textual contents, generally analyze the text for\\ndetecting fake news. In the modern news article, it is not only the\\ncollection of various texts but also a combination of text, images,\\naudio, and videos. Other type non-textual content is an analysis\\nof Images, URLs, sound, video, metadata of existing elements, web\\ntrack information, image captions. The content-based method ana-\\nlyzes the contents of news like text, image, video, or sound and uses\\nvarious machine learning techniques to analyze the content. The\\ncontent-based method incorporates Linguistic features, Writing\\nstyle features, Semantic features, Sentiment features, VisualBased\\nfeatures [4]. The basic language element analysis and sentence\\nstructure analysis are the significance of Linguistic features. For\\ndetecting fake news semantic features is one of the most important\\nfeatures. Sentiment analysis can detect the emotions and judgment\\nfrom any news article and it is very helpful for detecting false\\ninformation. There are several methods available for utilizing the\\nsentiment of news articles such as arousal valence dominance score,\\nhappiness detection and analysis, emotion analysis, and analysis\\nof polarization and strength. Sentiment analysis can also detect\\nfake bot accounts on social media. The visual-based feature ana-\\nlyzes the news visual contents: the number of images and videos,\\nmulti-image frequency, popular image frequency, and so on [4].\\n7.4 User Based\\nSocial media users are doing lots of activities on social media, these\\nactivities can give us strong clues about false information [11]. Au-\\nthors [4], divide the user-based method into 3 sub-categories such\\nas user profiling features analysis, posting behavior and temporal\\nfeatures analysis, and credibility features analysis. User profile fea-\\ntures contain fundamental user information such as the number\\nof followers, friends, number of statuses, location, profile creation\\ntime, profile creation date, verification information of users, etc.. By\\nanalyzing the information of the user, it can be possible to detect\\nthe activities of the user and this analysis is extremely helpful to\\ndetect fake or bot accounts on social media. It can be effective for\\ndetecting fake information because many fake users are spreading\\nfake news on social media. Fake accounts such as bots and cyborgs\\npost fake news within a specific certain time that creates a pattern.\\nPosting behaviors show the social media users posting pattern at\\na certain amount of time, time pattern between two successive\\nposts, sharing, mentioning, etc. User interaction on specific news\\nis very important to detect whether it is fake news or not, and this\\nanalysis is called credibility features analysis. If the news has got\\nmore interaction such as likes, shares and comments from unreli-\\nable users then there is a high chance that it is fake news. Research\\n[11] stated that any kind of user interaction analysis takes place in\\nthis category including user comments, Facebook likes etc. Social\\ncontext relies on the demography of the user. Different attributes of\\na user like their age, gender, education, and affiliations are observed\\nto standardize the user into a particular category [15]. Features of\\nthe user profile can be categorized as explicit and implicit features.\\nPreviously mentioned attributes are the implicit features and user’s\\nrow metadata are the explicit features such as their information\\ncredibility classification [15].\\n7.5 Geometric deep learning\\n7.5.1 Domain. Twitter\\n7.5.2 Theory. [8] The approached model is based on geometric\\ndeep learning. There are multiple deep learning methods that has a\\ngreat influence on other domains. Convolutional neural networks\\nand other popular deep neural models are completely based on\\nclassical signal processing theory. These models are organized as a\\ngrid-structured data. Recently, the technique is becoming so popular\\nto convert deep learning models as grid-structured non-Euclidean\\ndata. Since then, geometric deep learning is popular as a term\\nsimilar to non-Euclidean deep learning approaches.\\nFigure 2: The architecture of neural network model [8]', metadata={'source': 'A-comperative-analysis-on-fake-news-detection-methods.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Also, the model\\nhas been observed in different challenging settings. The model per-\\nforms extremely well and shows accuracy of 93% ROC AUC within\\njust a few hours of the propagation.\\n7.6 Multiple Feature based solution\\n7.6.1 Domain. Facebook. The solution provided here will analyze\\nsome features associated with Facebook accounts.\\n7.6.2 Theory. [13] Fake news detection approach provided in this\\npaper requires multiple classifiers. The description of each classifier\\ngiven below: A. Machine learning related classifiers: a. KNN: This\\ntechnique previously stores some predefined conditions and classi-\\nfies and it produces a new condition by measuring similarities. It\\nclassifies an object based on the popularity index of other members\\nin its neighborhood. The distance is calculated using Euclidean,\\nManhattan and Minkowski functions. b. Logistic regression: This\\nis the most appropriate method if dependent variable is in binary\\nform. Here, an output Y is predicted using some input parameters\\nwhere each parameter has different weights with some coefficient\\nvalues. The standard equation for this technique is given below:\\n𝑌 = 𝑒(𝑏0 + 𝑏1𝑋)/( 1 + 𝑒(𝑏0 + 𝑏1𝑋)) (3)\\nc. Decision tree: In this technique, all the classification model forms\\na tree structure and all the data is divided into sub segments. Every\\ndecision is indicated by an edge and the resultant output for that\\ndecision is presented by a node. Principle of entropy and Informa-\\ntion gain is used to build a decision tree. d. Naïve Bayes: This model\\nis based on probabilistic principle. The following equation is used\\nfor classification which is based on Bayes theorem-\\n𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) = (𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)𝑃(𝐴))/𝑃(𝐵) (4)\\nB. Deep learning related classifiers: In this proposed solution,\\nLSTM has been used which is a short form of ‘Long Short Term\\nMemory’. LSTM: It is a recursive neural network model that handle\\nlong time dependencies. It mainly remember information for a\\nlonger period of time. The flow of information within LSTM is\\noperated by multiple gates which are composed of sigmoid gate. It\\nis also called forget gate. The output in this gate will be either 0 or\\n1.\\n7.6.3 Main Methods. The solution is based on deep learning. Here,\\na chrome extension is designed which will analyze the user’s profile\\nas well as the other networks related to news dissipation. It uses\\nboth machine learning and deep learning method to extract neces-\\nsary data from the profiles. This approach consists of three different\\nphases. i. In phase 1, Information about a user is collected using\\ncrawler and Facebook API. Also, the collected data is preprocesses\\nand refined in that phase. Here, crawler extracts the public infor-\\nmation available on a user’s profile. Public information includes\\nfriends, followers, number of likes and choice of interests and other\\ninformation. Crawler also uses a Facebook API to access private\\ninformation on request. Crawler uses chrome environment and\\nuses the following algorithm to extract information:\\nAlgorithm: Collected dataset based on the extracted feature (UCF\\nfeatures and NCF features) Input: Facebook users list Output: Gen-\\neration of a labeled dataset for each Facebook profile in the list\\ndo Crawler extracts Facebook profile features, Store features in an\\nEXCEL file; Extraction of new features by using Facebook API and\\ncrawler is done based on the contents available; for each UCF by\\nmultiple profiles i.e. Post shared do Extract set of the crude dataset\\nfrom multiple features like Messages, Sharedmsg, Comment, Likes,\\nMultimedia content shared, Follower, Followings from FBp as an\\ninput parameter to the crawler\\nStore features in an EXCEL file; End for each NCF by multiple\\nprofiles i.e. News Post shared NPshared, do Extract set of the crude\\ndataset from multiple features like Source, Bodytext, Headlines,\\nTexts, Wordcount,Sentence from FBp as an input parameter to\\nthe crawler Store features in an EXCEL file. End Parse EXCEL\\nfiles and calculate the total and average values for each user post\\nPerformance are analyzed based on the stored files. End\\nExecuting the following algorithm, the crawler stores all the\\ninformation of the user in a XLS file. The XLS file gets updates each\\ntime when the user visits any other profiles. ii. In phase 2, all the\\ncollected data passes through deep learning and machine learning\\nbased classifiers. iii. In the phase 3, the most suitable classifier is\\nselected for fake news detection.\\n7.6.4 Accuracy. Only using machine learning algorithms doesn’t\\nprovide a better solution for detecting fake news.

Twitter (in twitter there are many tweets in news\\ncategory which can be noticed and gathered. For example, by using\\nthe advanced search API of Twitter with the title ‘news’).\\n7.7.2 Theory. Proposed detection method usually works with fake\\nnews which are unsupervised on Twitter by utilizing user’s erratic\\ninvolvement facts. The framework proposed in this paper called\\nUFD (Unsupervised Learning Framework) that uses a probabilistic\\ngraphical model in order to framework truthiness and credibility.\\nFor solving the inference issue Gibbs sampling method is suggested.\\nTwo real world social media datasets (LIAR and BuzzFeed) used to\\nconduct experiments. Firstly, authors have introduced the hierar-\\nchic social engagement framework, secondly presented difficulty\\nfeatures and lastly created a Bayesian network by formalize the\\nproblem.\\nProbabilistic Graphical Model: Probabilistic graphical model is a\\nframework to represent complex domains using probability distri-\\nbutions, with numerous applications in machine learning. Gibbs\\nSampling: Gibbs sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\\nalgorithm for obtaining a sequence of observations which are ap-\\nproximated from a specified multivariate probability distribution.\\nBayesian Network: Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical\\nmodel to represent knowledge about uncertain domain where every\\nnode corresponds to a random variable and every edge represents\\nthe conditional probability for the corresponding random variables.\\n7.7.3 Main Method. The collected information from the news\\ntweets holding the contents of the tweet like title, a link, a photo and\\nuser’s own textual contented. News tweet also has likes, retweets,\\nand replies from second-level users. Authors have divided two\\ngroups of users as verified and unverified. It has three-fold benefit.\\nFirstly, it can be beneficial to reduce the noise of data as there are\\nTable 3: Accuracy for both LIAR and BuzzFeed dataset\\nMethods Accuracy on LIAR Accuracy on BuzzFeed\\nMajority Voting 0.586 0.556\\nTruthFinder 0.634 0.554\\nLTM 0.641 0.465\\nCRH 0.639 0.562\\nUFD 0.759 0.679\\nso many unverified accounts those are not participate in so many\\nsocial engagements. Secondly, an implied supposition be forced in\\nthe paper which indicates verified users those who have huge num-\\nber of followers, effects, and more standing become more reliable\\nin differentiating fake or real news. Finally, reduction of the model\\nis the third advantage proposed by authors. By concentrating on a\\nsmall portion of data, simplification of the problem would be easier\\nas the data collected from the social media is complicated, noisy,\\nand incomplete. For the Problem Model section authors denoted\\nN as set of news, and M and K respectively verified and unverified\\nusers. Every given news i N, and authors have collected users\\ntweets for the following content who are verified. Mi M indicate\\nthe set of users who are verified and posted tweets for the news.\\nThe tweet of every verified user j Mi, authors have collected the\\nunverified user’s communal activities. Let Ki, j K indicate the set\\nof users who are unverified and participate in the tweet. For every\\nnews i, authors have used a l potential arbitrary variable xi 0, 1 to\\nindicate truthiness, for example, fake news (xi = 0) or true news (xi\\n= 1). Even if the news can be true or fake, users’ opinions is needed\\nto be extracted from their engagement behaviors on the news.\\nFake news detection is straightforward with the collapsed Gibbs\\nsampler having update rule. Firstly, authors estimated the news\\ntruth by initializing randomly to either 0 or 1, and compute the\\nsum up of every verified and unverified user depending on previous\\nestimated truth result. Afterwards, the authors perform sampling\\nprocedure repeatedly. In each iteration, authors estimated every\\nnews sampling from its distribution conditioned on present approx-\\nimation of every other news stated and accordingly update the sum\\nup of every user.\\n7.7.4 Accuracy. For the experiment authors have used two datasets\\nwhich are public. For example, LIAR (Wang 2017) and BuzzFeed\\nNews for evaluating performance of the method. One of the largest\\nfake news datasets is LIAR, holding above 12,800 minified news.\\n1,627 news articles are being hold by BuzzFeed connected with\\nU.S. election from Facebook. Authors have used the consecutive\\nbenchmarks to evaluate execution of the detecting method: accu-\\nracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, could be commonly used for\\nevaluating performance of classification methods. The proposed\\nalgorithm is compared with four other unsupervised fake news\\ndetection benchmarks which are Majority Voting, TruthFinder [19],\\nLTM [21], CRH [? ]. Table 4 and Table 5 shows experiment outcomes\\nof LIAR and BuzzFeed Datasets respectively.\\n8 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\\nAs most of the fake news region are based on social media and\\nonline news article, we analyzed both areas detection articles and', metadata={'source': 'A-comperative-analysis-on-fake-news-detection-methods.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A Comparative Analysis on Fake News Detection Methods Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\\ncome across the below comparative table. All of the mentioned\\nmethodologies belong to social media region but only no. 3 also\\nbelongs to online news article. It can be assumed from the table that\\non social media fake news mostly spread through either Facebook\\nor Twitter as the number of users in these two platforms are huge.\\nSo, all the articles that we analyzed are tested one of these media\\nplatform. We find that for detection of fake news, linguistic, data\\nscience and machine learning techniques are the most commonly\\nused. Na¨ıve bayes, Multiple Feature which uses NLP, Random\\nForest, SVM and ML + Deep Learning accordingly have an accuracy\\nof 75.4% and 99%. So, it is obvious that if one wants to work with\\nFacebook originate news, he/she can work with these methods but\\nfor verifying a news based on its accuracy Multiple Feature method-\\nology will be the best. For twitter, we analyzed Propagation path\\nclassification, Content based method and Unsupervised learning.\\nPropagation path classification uses convolutional network carry-\\ning an accuracy of 85%, Geometric deep learning is based on deep\\nlearning methods including Euclidean convolutional network hav-\\ning an accuracy of 93% and lastly, we have unsupervised learning\\nwhich has a highest accuracy of 75.9%. Research work on twitter-\\nbased news can be done by using these methods efficiently but for\\nverifying a news it is suggested to go for Geometric Deep Learning\\nmethods as it gives highest accuracy. A comparative table is given\\nin the next page for better clarification:\\nTable 4: Comparison between various fake news detection\\nmethods\\nNo Method\\nname\\nDomain Area Accuracy\\n1 Propagation\\npath classi-\\nfication\\nConvolutional\\nNetwork\\nWeibo,\\nTwitter\\n85% on\\nTwitter 92%\\non Weibo\\n2 Naïve\\nBayes\\nNaïve\\nBayes\\nFacebook 75.40%\\n3 Content\\nBased\\nNatural\\nLanguage\\nProcessing,\\nRandom\\nForest,\\nSVM (Sup-\\nport Vector\\nMachine)\\nNews Arti-\\ncle, Twitter\\nNon tex-\\ntual: 73%\\n4 User Based N/A Social Me-\\ndia\\nN/A\\n5 Geometric\\nDeep Learn-\\ning\\nDeep\\nLearning,\\nEuclidean\\nconvo-\\nlutional\\nnetwork\\nTwitter 93% ROC\\n6 Multiple\\nFeature\\nBased\\nMachine\\nLearning\\n+ Deep\\nLearning\\nFacebook 99%\\n7 Unsupervised\\nlearning\\nUnsupervised\\nlearning\\nframework\\nTwitter 75.9 %\\n(LIAR\\nDataset)\\n67.9 %\\n(Buzzfeed\\nDataset)\\nAmong all the approaches given in the following table, user-\\nbased approach does not have any actual experimental accuracy\\nvalue as it is still under development and not yet have been imple-\\nmented. So, further research is needed to use this as a fake news\\ndetection method. Also, all the approaches given here works dif-\\nferently based on the situation and accuracy which also varies in\\ndifferent platforms. So, there is an opportunity to work with an\\nAI based solution which can actually work uniformly in all social\\nmedia accounts by learning all the characteristics all by itself.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Jonathan Albright. 2017.
